		 Welcome to PeerPal, where we want to make a better and safer school environment. We want to try and make life in schools safer for everyone possible, including students, teachers, and staff. We are using an anonymous reporting website where the messages and files/screenshots will be sent to the principal and office of the selected school. This will also show the informer that the message has been seen or not because we know it is stressful to not know if it is safe or not at your own school. So that is where we are improving life of schools and the people of the schools. Our ultimate goal is to be able to keep everyone at school safe from threats on a bigger scale. So we hope you can use our program and keep schools safe.
